Here's how it works:

- Think about the feature you want! Check out the list for inspiration!
- Join the queue bot on slack and fork/star the repository
- Once you're pinged by the queue, you'll get 2 hours to implement your feature to the board (though you can take a tad bit longer if you're actually working on it, but try to spend only 2 hours)
- Make a PR with your submission and I'll merge it for you ASAP
