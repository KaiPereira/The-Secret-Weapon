<h1 style="text-align:center"> We're making the largest collaborative PCB </h1>

The Secret Weapon is a collaborative event where highschoolers each design and add a unique feature to a massive shared PCB.

If you're a highschooler and want to add in your feature, join the slack channel #The-Secret-Weapon through Hackclub to find the active discussion and then follow the submission process!
